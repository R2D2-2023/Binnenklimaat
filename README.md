# Binnenklimaat
## Introduction
Binnenklimaat is a repository for sensors and for sending data useing LoRa to the back-end. We use an arduino and a Pycom Lopy4 in our project. The arduino fetches the data from the chips and sends it through a serial bus to the Pycom Lopy4. The Pycom Lopy4 then sends that sensor data through a Long-Range ( Lo-Ra ) protocol to the TheThingsNetwork server from the back-end. The arduino code is written in C++ and the Pycom Lopy4 code is written in micro-Python.
What our chips measure:
```* Temperature
* Humidity
* CO2 level
* Airpressure
* particulate matter
* Voltsensor ( Sensor is damaged )
```
These measurements, with the location of team "positie bepalen" are send to the back-end server.

## Hardware
```The chips we use in our project are and what they are used for:
* BME280 ( Temperature, Humidity, Airpressure )
* SCD30 ( CO2 Level ) 
* SPS30 ( Particulate Matter )
* INA266 (Volt Sensor)
```

## How we send and incrypt our data.
```
Value = measured value by sensor

(T) temp = range: 0-100 - 1 byte (real temp = value / 2) (resolution = 0.5Â°C)
(H) humidity = range: 0-100 - 1 byte (real humidity = value) (resolution = 3%)
(C) co2 = range: 0-200 - 1 byte (real co2 = value * 10) (resolution = 30ppm + 3% measured value)
(P) pressure = range: 0-250 - 1 byte (real pressure = value + 800) (resolution = 0.25%)

sent message would be:
THCP (T H C P)


Our message will be send in bytes, particulate matter and position will not be included yet

End-point users needs to decrypt and to use our made formulas to get the correct data. Otherwise it will be faulty.

## Installation
Libraries we use for C++ code:
```* Wire
* SPI
* Adafruit_Sensor
* Adafruit_BME280
* Adafruit_SCD30
* Arduino
```

Libraries we use for Python code:
```* socket
* binascii
* struct
* time
* config
* network ( LoRa )
```
